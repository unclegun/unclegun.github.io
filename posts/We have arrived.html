                <p>welp it took me two days but I propped up this site.
                I knew nothing about github pages and all the hoops
                involved, but hey we’re here. Let me recap for those who
                may decide to set up a static website in the most back
                asswards way possible: - create a repo in github named
                username.github.io - this will be your site (just like
                mine!) - enable github pages in the settings and set it
                to the main branch (if you toggle between
                main/docs/none/whatever you’ll be able to save changes.
                fun feature.) - add some pages to the repo root. this
                will be the funnest part of the process. - commit and
                push that shiz and if you’re lucky it’ll be up and
                running so yeah this will make a boring ole site with
                baby’s first website vibes, but I wanted to make a blog
                to post my rambling. For this, we look to… github
                actions. again, never messed with them but only knew
                they existed in some capacity. Turns out to be really
                powerful and rage inducing. Lets dive in - actions uses
                a yml file to give a whole bunch instructions to github
                that can automate things. neat! - I needed this to
                generate the json (and eventually the html) behind each
                blog post because github pages is static so there’s no
                backend out of the box - sooooo you gotta create a
                authentication token (the classic one not the new one…
                for reasons), then add that token into the yml and after
                several fights with chatGPT (who will now be referred to
                as Jeeves) we have a json file that is generated with
                builds the html pages which is committed through the
                actions. yeah. “but how do you generate the json?” I
                hear you ask. We use markdown! New to me, markdown is
                like html but slightly dumber but can be just as
                effective, like slingblade. The easiest way to generate
                markdown that the actions will convert into json is
                through Obsidian. Its a fancy note taking app but
                outputs in markdown. It also has a robust tag feature
                that we can use to parse the pieces needed for the json
                to be created. Seems kinda
                easy/silly/boring/whoareyoutalking to, but hey we’re
                here now and let’s hope I keep talking to myself for a
                while.</p>
