Let me recap for those who may decide to set up a static website in the most back asswards way possible: - create a repo in github named username.github.io - this will be your site (just like mine!) - enable github pages in the settings and set it to the main branch (if you toggle between main/docs/none/whatever you'll be able to save changes. fun feature.) - add some pages to the repo root. this will be the funnest part of the process.
